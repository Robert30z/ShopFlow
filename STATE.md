# ShopFlow — STATE

> Update this file at the end of every working session so the next session resumes instead of restarting.

## Last updated: 2026-07-03

## New 2026-07-03 (later 4): Real intake flow + work order
- Wizard order now matches the shop: Cliente → Fotos → **Servicios → Estimado → FIRMA de
  autorización** → Inspección → Denegados → Firma final → Cierre. Services + prices exist BEFORE
  the customer signs (diag $80 case; oil+coolant upsell case).
- `RO.auth1` frozen at signature: itemized services (svc price, labor h × rate, parts) + total.
- `workOrderPDF()`: ORDEN DE TRABAJO with prices + embedded authorization signature — printer
  button in wizard nav + abierta detail. Paper copy for the car/técnico.
- `techNotes` prints on receipt (NOTAS), work order, and RO detail. "+ Servicio manual" button.
- Step-index hooks moved: buildEstSum n===3, renderAutoRecs/DenList n===6. saveRO redirect gotoStep(2).
- **Pages deploy note**: deploy-step failures were the ~10-deploys/hour Pages rate limit (build job
  was green). If deploy fails: wait for the hour window, next push retriggers. .nojekyll added anyway.
- Smoke = 49 checks.

## New 2026-07-03 (later 3): Offline PWA + WhatsApp + payment tracking
- **Offline**: sw.js (network-first shell, cache-first CDN/assets — bump CACHE_V on strategy change)
  + manifest.json + icons (180/192/512). App verified loading fully with network cut. Installable
  from Safari "Add to Home Screen". NOTE: single-file rule now has 3 sanctioned satellites
  (sw.js, manifest.json, icons) — no build step, still no npm deps.
- **WhatsApp** (wa.me deep links, no backend): "Enviar por WhatsApp" in RO detail (receipt summary;
  PDF still shared via native sheet), green "Recordar" button on home maintenance notifs
  (pre-written reminder). waNum() normalizes PR 10-digit → 1XXXXXXXXXX.
- **Payment tracking**: new ROs default estado 'pendiente' (select synced at pane build AND step 6,
  Pendiente first option); green "Marcar PAGADO" button in detail sets estado+pagadoFecha.
  "Hoy"/"Por cobrar" tiles now reflect reality.
- Smoke test now 44 checks + separate offline reload verification.

## New 2026-07-03 (later 2): Cloud backup + terms v3
- **Auto-backup to private GitHub repo**: every saveDB schedules a push (45s debounce) of the full
  DB (minus aiKey + backup token) to `shopflow_backup.json` in a user-owned PRIVATE repo via the
  GitHub contents API. Ajustes card: repo + fine-grained token (Contents R/W, single repo),
  status w/ last-backup time, "Respaldar ahora" and "Restaurar" (restore keeps local secrets).
  Git history of the backup repo = point-in-time recovery. NOT yet live-tested against the real
  GitHub API — Roberto must create repo + token and hit "Respaldar ahora" once to confirm.
- **TERMS_VERSION=3**: customer-supplied-parts jobs now carry NO warranty at all (parts or labor);
  30d/1,000mi warranty applies only when Pit Stop supplied the part. Old ROs keep their frozen v2.
- Smoke test now 37 checks.

## New 2026-07-03 (later): Terms version-stamping + 30-day warranty + photo evidence
- `TERMS_VERSION=2` / `TERMS_DATE` constants; DISC clause 2 now covers **mano de obra y piezas
  suplidas por Pit Stop, 30 días / 1,000 millas**, excludes customer parts / wear items / misuse.
- On first signature, the current terms text is FROZEN into `RO.terms` {v, fecha, text}. PDFs print
  the frozen text with "v2 — vigentes y aceptados al firmar (fecha)". Editing DISC later never
  changes what old ROs show. When editing terms in the future: bump TERMS_VERSION + TERMS_DATE.
- Photos are now `{d: dataURL, t: ISO}` (old string format still supported via fotoSrc/fotoTime).
  Capture timestamp shows on wizard grid, RO detail "Fotos de entrada" gallery, and the new
  full-screen viewer (tap thumbnail → prev/next + "Capturada: <fecha completa>").
- Smoke test now 34 checks.

## New 2026-07-03: Open RO (draft save) + real signature persistence — "the legal SAVE button"
- Signature pads now persist the actual ink (canvas → PNG dataURL in `RO.sigData`) plus signing
  timestamp (`RO.sigTimes`) the moment the customer lifts their finger. Survives app close.
- 💾 button in the wizard nav = `saveOpenRO()`: saves at ANY step (only requires client name),
  estado `'abierta'`, upserts by RO id. Blue "Abierta" badge in Órdenes/Historial/detail.
- RO detail for abiertas: shows stored signature images w/ timestamps + "Continuar orden" button
  → `continueRO()` reloads everything into the wizard (fields, inspection, photos, signatures re-drawn).
- Completing a resumed RO upserts (no duplicates), creates the garage entry once, estado from the
  Estimado select. PDFs now embed BOTH stored signatures with real signing timestamps (re-export
  works forever, no more "(Sin firma digital capturada)").
- Photos now compressed on capture (max 1280px, JPEG 72%) — protects localStorage quota.
- `saveDB()` failure is no longer silent: loud alert telling the user to export backup + free space.
- Smoke test extended to 29 checks covering the full draft lifecycle.

## Previous: 2026-07-02

## What's built and verified working
- 10 screens: home dashboard, RO wizard (9 steps), garage, órdenes, clientes, menú/POS,
  finanzas (P&L/suplidores/inventario/gastos), historial (día/todas/clientes), inventario, ajustes.
- Full RO lifecycle verified end-to-end with headless browser (2026-07-02): create → canvas
  signatures → 36-point inspection → services + IVU 11.5% math → save → garage
  working→ready→entregado → PDF generate/download/re-export → delete w/ confirm.
- Backup export/import, quick orders from menú, client auto-save, VIN scanner modal (needs camera).

## Fixed 2026-07-02 (full diagnostic + repair session)
1. AI features (diagnóstico, part suggest/describe, labor estimate): were calling the Anthropic API
   with no key/headers — never worked. Now: shared `aiFetch()` helper, user API key in Ajustes
   (localStorage only), correct headers incl. `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access`,
   model `claude-opus-4-8`, graceful "configura tu key" message when unset.
2. `renderAutoRecs` was called but never defined (JS error on Denegados step; feature dead).
   Implemented: red inspection items now auto-appear in Denegados with price input + Registrar.
3. Inventario "Agregar" was dead (guard on nonexistent `#inv-form`). Removed — modal opens.
4. Órdenes cards had no tap handler. Now reuse `roCardHTML` → tap opens RO detail + PDF re-export.
5. Deleting an RO now removes its garage entry (was orphaned as "working"); garage entries carry
   `roId`. Totals rounded to 2 decimals on save.

## Next 3 things
1. Have Roberto add his Anthropic API key in Ajustes and confirm the 4 AI buttons live on the iPad.
2. Consider a "Pendiente"-first workflow: RO defaults to estado "pagado" — counts revenue before
   the customer pays. Maybe default "pendiente" + one-tap "marcar pagado" in RO detail.
3. SaaS groundwork: multi-shop data model (namespace localStorage key per shop / move to backend).

## Current known quirks (not bugs)
- VIN scanner requires camera permission; in-browser test environments show a harmless "Not supported".
- AI features require the user's own API key; keep it out of the repo (public!).
